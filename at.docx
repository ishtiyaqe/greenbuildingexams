Chapter1 – Introduction to Green Buildings & LEED
Credentials
1.1 What are the characteristics of Green Buildings?
Green Buildings are
 Energy Efficient
 Water Efficient
 Provide better Indoor Environment& hence better living conditions
 Use environmental friendly or sustainable materials
 Produce Less waste
 Have lesser transportation requirement
 Protect/restore habitat
The above characteristics results in reduced environmental impact
throughout the lifecycle of the building
Learning Objectives

• What is the significance of Green Buildings?
• What are the various Green Building rating systems?
• Why LEED?
• What are the various LEED Credentials?
• LEED Examination information

1.2 What is the Significance of Green Buildings?
The major environmental challenges today are
• Climate change
• Depletion of resources
• Ozone depletion
• Land pollution
• Water Pollution
• Air Pollution
There is a common perspective that industries are the major part of
greenhouse gas emissions. Interestingly fig 1.1 shows that buildings are the
major contributors towards greenhouse gas emissions

Buildings directly contribute towards all the above environmental pollution.
Green Buildings can be major part of the solution to these environmental
issues.
Interest for Green Buildings has gained significant momentum in GCC
countries. Hence, we would like to provide some specific statistics related
to GCC countries. Fig 1.2 shows that percapita CO2 emission1
ishigher in GCC
countries. This could be because of climatic conditions, life style, lack of
infrastructure related to public transportation etc.
Fig 1.2Percapita CO2 Emissions of various countries
Fig 1.3 shows that Green Buildings can significantly reduce the resources
used in buildings and contribute to reduced environmental impact.
1Percapita CO2 emission is theCO2 emission of the country divided by midyear population.

1.3 How a building can be certified as Green Building?
Buildings are certified as Green Buildings byvarious Green Building rating
systems.Green Building rating systems are tools which assess the building
on various aspects like energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials used,
indoor environmental quality, location of site etc and certify the buildings if
they qualify their preset criteria.
There are numerous Green Building rating systems across the world. Belowis a partial list of various Green Building rating systems
• Australia: Green Star
• Brazil: AQUA / LEED Brazil • Canada: LEED Canada/ Green Globes
• China: GB Evaluation standard for green building

• Germany: DGNB
• Hong Kong: HKBEAM
• India: GRIHA and IGBC
• United Arab Emirates: Pearl Rating System
• United States: LEED
• United Kingdom: BREEAM
• Taiwan: EEWH

1.4 Why LEED?
When there are various Green Building rating systems, why should
someone bother about LEED? Here are some of the reasons
• LEED- Internationally recognized Green Building rating system
• Adapted in many countries like Brazil and Canada
• Popular& accepted in GCC countries. Fig 1.4 shows that there are more
than 750 LEED registered projects1 and 180+ LEED Certified Projects2
in
GCC countries.
1LEED registered projects: LEED registered projects are the projects which has expressed their
interest to be LEED certified by filling an online application form. Registered projects are
analogous to candidates who have applied for the exam
2LEED Certified Projects: LEED Certified projects are the projects which has been successfully
assessed by GBCI and got LEED Certified. Certified projects are analogous to candidates who
have successfully passed the examination.

LEED Green Associate: LEED Green Associates have understanding of green
building design, construction and operations. They possess knowledge level
equivalent to 200 in LEED core curriculum.
LEED AP: LEED Accredited Professionals will be able to implement their
knowledge by facilitating Certification process in a particular LEED rating
system. They possess knowledge level equivalent to 300 in the LEED core
curriculum. LEED AP Credential comes with a specialty; candidates can
choose the specialty based on their profile. For example a Professional in
design or construction may prefer to be a LEED AP BD+C; while a facility
manager shall be interested in LEED AP O+M.
LEED Fellow: LEED fellows are LEED APs who have demonstrated
exceptional achievement in LEED and Green Buildings.
